<div>
  <p>It works only on Chrome Browser, just plug usb digispark and wait. It takes around 10 seconds to get local state, login data files, compress and send to target email, after you'll have to decrypt these files.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p>I'm uploading this version without decrypt because the version with decrypt is slower and won't run if you don't own administrator permissions because the windwos defender detects.</p>
  <p>To disable real time protection in windows defender you must have administrator. </p>
